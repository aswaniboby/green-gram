## Project Title
GreenGram - A Digital platform for Sustainable Living and Community Eco-Actions

## Problem Statement Addressed
Eco-awareness and Sustainable lifestyle tools.

## Project Overview

>What it does:
Green Gram is a digital platform that empowers individuals and communities alike to inculcate sustainable habits, keep record of their actions, and join forces for a greener environment.

>How it works: 
People enter green choices on a daily basis in the app: recycling, single use plastics, clean transport, and so on. Then, the app projects the impact through dashboards and gamified rewards. It serves as a one-stop shop for users to find local eco-events to participate in, tips for daily eco life, and a community feed whereby users can share their green efforts with others. Visual reports, tagging, barriers clear progress charts all work together in keeping environmental motivation alive among users while also making them aware of their ecological footprints.

>Who it benefits:
*People who want to be green
*Communities and eco clubs that carry out green activities
*Schools and students who endeavor to learn sustainable practices
*Local governments and NGOs seeking to create outreach programs that further green efforts
